HW-9	CS451	10 points	Due: Due: Monday 11/2/2020

For this assignment you need to write a program that spawns 
10 threads, uses command-line arguments, and that reads and 
writes files. 

The command-line argument will be "mutex" or "nomutex". When
running in "nomutex" mode the 10 threads will each read 1 word
at a time from a file (hw9.data) and write that word to another
file (hw9.nomutex). I suggest you include a sleep() to slow 
things down a bit. After all, you do want the two versions to
produce different results.

When running in "mutex" mode any thread that wants to read a 
word must first set a mutex, when the word is written to the 
output file the mutex is released. The output filename here 
is hw9.mutex.

Output fle format (both files):
word	<tab>	thread_number_that_wrote_word
word	<tab>	thread_number_that_wrote_word
word	<tab>	thread_number_that_wrote_word
   .

Input file format:

In your comment section, provide a brief analysis of the results 
(compare the two output files).
