Improved Scale and Rotation Invariant Correlation Using Block median Filtering An improvement on the scale and rotation tolerant correlation method first proposed by Casesent and Psaltis is presented In computer simulations using a target set of scaled and rotated objects the system accurately identified the targets with accuracy We preprocess the target and reference images with a centering algorithm a log polar transform a modified median filter and a Laplace edge extracting filter The resulting image data when correlated using a typical correlator exhibits good scale and rotation tolerance Key Words Optical correlation Matched filters Pattern recognition Pattern matching is defined as the problem of evaluating the similarity of objects in different images Pattern matching can be a complex and difficult problem Obviously we need to be able to recognize objects that are not scaled or rotated However we frequently need to recognize objects that are scaled or rotated or both In addition to being able to recognize scaled and rotated objects characteristics such as discriminability computational complexity ease of training flexibility and noise resistance need to be considered as well pattern matching techniques calculate a feature set for the unknown pattern and compare those features with a library of preclassified features Using some metric the unknown pattern is assigned to classes of the known patterns Methods using this approach include nearest neighbor methods correlation methods and neural network methods Correlation methods are very popular and powerful Many methods have been proposed for shift rotation and scale invariance correlation filters or architectures Two examples of invariant correlation methods include circular harmonic expansions and Fourier Mellin transforms Circular harmonic expansions can be used to achieve rotation invariance Shift rotation and scale invariance can be achieved using the Fourier Mellin transform However since the Fourier Mellin transform is based on the magnitude of the Fourier transform correlation methods based on this transform are generally unreliable for identification or location purposes Neural networks processing digitally computed image moments and neural networks using specially designed detectors or camera systems have also been proposed for shift rotation and scale invariant pattern recognition Our goal was to improve the scale and rotation tolerant correlation method first proposed by Casesent and Psaltis resulting in a pattern recognition method that would provide affine transformation tolerance be computationally inexpensive be easy to train and be flexible The proposed method uses Laplace filtering block median filtering log polar and Fourier transforms and a centering routine A diagram of the correlation process including the production of the matched filters is shown in Since the log polar transform is not shift invariant a foveation or centering step is applied first We center the images by repositioning the images such that their centroids correspond to the image center This is followed by a backward mapped log polar transform The log polar mapping is traditionally computed using a forward mapping approach However Mehanian and Rak have shown that due to the discrete nature of computer simulations the forward mapping approach can result in artifacts and proposed the use of a backward mapping approach given by Theoretically the log polar transform should provide scale and rotation invariance However a digital implementation of a log polar transform introduces aliasing Therefore instead of achieving scale and rotation invariance only scale and rotation tolerance are obtained Application of a modified median filter reduces the aliasing effects introduced by the log polar transform Improving the scale and rotation tolerance Several techniques were evaluated for reducing the sampling errors introduced by the log polar transformation A variation on median filtering was deemed the most promising and computationally efficient To prevent confusion with the standard median filtering method the variation developed will be referred to as block median filtering Block median filtering is performed  as follows Before block median filtering can be applied the values of M and N must be determined The value of M is determined by the user and is driven by the log polar angular sampling rate The value of N is determined by the radial sampling rate of the log polar transform Since the radial sampling rate is a function of the distance from the image center the value of N varies with distance from the image center The objective is to select a set of values for N such that the regions have a radial width approximately equal to pixel wide rings in the original image An example of the selection of N is shown in Figure The effect of the block median filtering is shown in Figure The top row contains three rotations of the letter The middle row contains the Laplace filtered log polar transforms of the top row images The bottom row contains the block median filtered Laplace filtered log polar transforms of the top row images Note that aside from the differences due to the shift the rotated now has a transformation much more like the other two The improvement in similarity also improves the correlation results To increase the brightness and sharpness of correlation peaks the log polar transformation results are edge filtered using a Laplace kernel To guarantee that the result is binary a simple segmentation algorithm is applied after the Laplace filter Experimental results were obtained with a computer simulation The target set consisted of binary images of the upper case letters of the English alphabet The image size was pixels the font was bold face Courier New and the characters were randomly positioned in the image Rotated and scaled versions of the targets were obtained by applying digital rotation and scaling routines Twenty six matched HBPOFs were generated one filter for each letter The filters were generated from the centered non scaled and non rotated versions of the letters We present a variation on the Fourier Mellin correlation architecture originally proposed by Cassesent and Psaltis The variation applies a block median filtering routine to reduce the sampling errors introduced by the digitally computed log polar transform We use the Hartley binary phase only filter for its discrimination characteristics We record the maximum peak value as each filter is attempted and classify the target as a member of the object class filter resulted in the highest peak value With this approach we achieve good scale and rotation tolerance Using rotated and scaled binary images of the letters of the alphabet the proposed architecture accurately identified of the target set images Analysis of the incorrectly classified objects suggests that the approach is not overly sensitive to any particular in plane distortion Furthermore proposals have been made for the optical generation of the Mellin transform Such methods may provide for an all optical implementation of our proposed refinements Future work will further address the issue of the effect of sampling errors and will address the issue of rejecting objects that are not part of the target set
